/*
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the oldest-known algorithms, used for deriving prime numbers!
The sieve works by first assuming that all numbers from {2,â€¦,n}
are prime, and then successively marking them as NOT prime.

The algorithm works as follows:

Create a list of all integers from 2 to n.
Start with the smallest number in the list (2, the smallest prime number).
Mark all multiples of that number up to n as not prime.
Move to the next non-marked number and repeat this process until the entire list has been covered.
When the steps are complete, all remaining non-marked numbers are prime.

Optimizations:
 - change end boundary of outer loop from n to the square root of n, because inner loop already covers multiples of current no
 - change starting boundary of inner loop from i to i squared because outer loop already covers individual numbers
 - pre-mark all even numbers as false (non-prime)
Time complexity: O(nlog(logn))
